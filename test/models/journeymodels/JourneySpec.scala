     * What is the purpose of this test?
     * The Journey class stores and manages user-entered data and API responses throughout the user's journey.
     * It is important to invalidate certain API responses when the user-entered data they depend on is changed.
     * For example, if the user's nino is updated, all API responses should be set to None because they depend on the nino.
     * The update methods in the Journey class handle this invalidation to ensure data consistency and prevent the use of stale data.
     *
     * How the test works?
     * This test operates on assumption that all API
     * responses are defined in journey after all other fields starting with 'referenceCheckResult'
